## API Consideration and Structure

# Data I have available:

1. Topics
 2. Articles with various queries (by topic, author, sort by votes, etc.)
 3. Comments associated with articles
 4. User profiles and associated comments

# Plan:

1. Routes for articles which includes main page, filtered by topic, individual articles.
 2. Comments displayed with each article
 3. A fixed “logged-in” user for simplicity

# User Stories:

1. As a user, I want to see a list of articles sorted by votes, so I can easily find popular content.

2. As a user, I want to filter articles by topics, so I can view only the articles that interest me.

3. As a user, I want to post comments on an article, so I can engage in discussions.

4. As a user, I want to upvote an article or comment, so I can express my approval.

5. As a user, I want to delete my comments, so I can control my contributions.
